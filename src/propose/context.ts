/**
 * Facts about the running deployment that the compose file alone does not state.
 *
 * A compose file says a service is on the `traefik` network; it does not say that
 * network is `10.0.74.0/24`. When an upstream tells you to set a trusted-proxy range,
 * the compose file cannot answer the question and the model has to guess. It guessed
 * `172.16.0.0/12` on the first real proposal here -- the documented Docker default,
 * and wrong for this host.
 *
 * Everything gathered here is structural: network names, subnets, and the names and
 * images of sibling services. No environment values, no secrets, nothing from `.env`.
